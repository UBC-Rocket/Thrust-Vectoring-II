Block 1 : Thrust input Block
Inputs:
Avg Thrust (Newtons): Average thrust force.
Out of Angle (Degrees): Angle deviation for thrust (converted to radians using D2R).
Moment Arm TVC to COM: Distance from the thrust vector control (TVC) to the center of mass (COM).
Outputs:
Fx (N): Force along the x-axis.
Fz (N): Force along the z-axis.
M (N-m): Moment generated about the center of mass.





Block 2 : 

3DOF Block
This block calculates:
Position (Xe, Ze).
Velocity (U, W).
Angular velocity (ω) and acceleration (dω/dt).
Forces (Fx, Fz) and Moment (M) received from the Thrust Input Block.

Block 3: Scopes Block
This block visualizes the results:
Inputs: Outputs from the Thrust Input and 3DOF Blocks (e.g., position, forces, and angular data).
Outputs: Visualizations like graphs for:
Position (Xe, Ze) vs. Time.
Velocity (U, W) vs. Time.
Angular velocity and acceleration.

	







Block 4: PID input , Target Setpoint and etc:
Inputs: Parameters for PID control, target setpoint, division block values, and servo-related configurations.
Outputs: Visualizing the Target Setpoint, Orientation, and PID Output on a graph.
Division Block: A section where the user can adjust the PID variable and division factor.
Main Visualization: A dynamic plot showing the relationship between the Target Setpoint, Orientation, and PID Output.
